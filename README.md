# Eye-of-Targon
League of Legends Stat Tracker application currently being worked on. <br>
NOTE: Project was built out of the public project https://github.com/Liew211/lolwinrates <br>
End goal is to have the program curate a database of all games for the user, maintain and update it, and provide useful statistical insights from the data<br>

Current goals: <br>
-Implement a GUI for easier use <br>
-Save data to JSON file for future analysis, allow for "updates" to retrieve new data<br>
-Add a new argument to DisplayWinrates to filter for position. Alternatively, change back to all positions and implement a data filter<br>
-Add ARAM?<br>
-Produce better tools for analyzing data - ie, analyze over time period, stamp games with times<br>
